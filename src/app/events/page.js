          At Orbis Events, we believe that gaming should not just be about
          sitting idle, battling, and accumulating resources; it should also be
          about coming together, making new friends, participating in events and
          having a blast while doing it. That's why we actively organize a wide
          range of competitive events that cater to a variety of tastes and
          preferences.
